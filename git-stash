What is git stash for?
When you have made changes that you are not ready to commit.
Maybe you need to switch branches without a commit.
When you want to revert back temporariliy to where it was that you started but you dont know what to do with your changes.
If you made changes on the wrong branch.

How to use gite stash:
1.git branch my-feature
2.git checkout my-feature
make changes
3.git diff
4.git stash save"Add description of stashed file"
git stash list
At this point working tree will be clean and changes will be no longer visible and you can move away from your stashed work.
When you want to return to your stashed work

1.git stash apply stash@{0} will apply target stash but leave a copy in your stash
2.git stash pop will merge the lowest stash{0} number to its original branch and delete that left over stash file
git stash list "working tree now clean" 

Other commands
git stash drop stash@{0}     -delete target stash item
git stash clear              -deletes all stash
